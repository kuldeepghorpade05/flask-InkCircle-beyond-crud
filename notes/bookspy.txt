Key Differences from FastAPI to Flask:
MongoDB instead of SQL: Using pymongo with ObjectId

Flask-RESTX instead of FastAPI: Different decorators and request handling

JWT Authentication: Using flask_jwt_extended instead of FastAPI's OAuth2

Synchronous: Flask is synchronous while your FastAPI version was async

Error Handling: Custom error responses instead of raising exceptions

The endpoints match your FastAPI structure but adapted for Flask + MongoDB!
